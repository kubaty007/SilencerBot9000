# SilencerBot 9000 â€“ The Silence Guardian for Developers

SilencerBot 9000 is an advanced noise monitoring device designed for developer spaces. When conversations exceed the acceptable noise level, the bot instantly reacts by sending a message to the company's Discord, reminding the team to maintain a quiet environment.

## How It Works

1. **Noise Sensor** â€“ A digital sound sensor connected to an Arduino monitors the noise levels in the room.
2. **Arduino as a Signal Processor** â€“ When the noise surpasses a predefined threshold, Arduino sends a signal to the computer.
3. **Python Communication Program** â€“ A Python script receives the signal from Arduino and sends an HTTP request to the server.
4. **API Server (Express.js)** â€“ The API server written in Express.js processes the request and forwards it to the Discord bot.
5. **Discord Bot** â€“ The bot posts a message on the companyâ€™s Discord server, notifying the team to keep the noise down.

Ideal for companies where developers love to debateâ€¦ but sometimes forget that others are trying to work! ðŸš€
